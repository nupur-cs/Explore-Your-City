# Explore-Your-City
Explore Your City is a Java-based  web  designed for students to discover their city.For new student in the city, and it's been overwhelming trying to find essential information like affordable housing and local hangouts. The existing city guides are not tailored to student needs, and the information is scattered."
Events, study spaces, and relevant services are changing constantly. It's challenging to stay in the loop and feel connected. I've also noticed a lack of integration with academic resources. The app provides information on local attractions, restaurants, hostels, institutes, libraries and events. It also adapt the daily changing needs of student. With Explore Your City, students can make the most of their time in the city.
